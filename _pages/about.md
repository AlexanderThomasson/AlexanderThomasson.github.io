This website is begining stages of my programming journey being displayed in a meaningful way. Unfortunately there isn't much to show at the moment, but I intend on growing and developing this site as I grow.

About me
======
I am an electrical and computer engineering student that transfered in from Tidewater Community College. I was born and raised in Virginia Beach and have my Associates in engineering. Since my major path was originally just Electrical engineering I've only have some minor programming experience and most of that was using specific programs. Due to this fact I won't have much in my portfolio for projects and my programming style might be stiff and unrefined. Additionally, since I am a recent transfer most of my fundamental classes came from a different school so I have less background information compared to other students. Even with those disadvantages I am working hard and continue striving.
